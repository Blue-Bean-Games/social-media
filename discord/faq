Welcome to the official Blue Bean Games discord! :blob_excited: 

**__Who are we?__**
Blue Bean Games is a newly-formed game studio that believes in the power of open-source software. All of our work is completely dedicated to the public domain from company literature to video games. Currently we have members on the team from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Algeria. 

**__What does open-source mean?__**
Open source means anyone can alter, modify or enhance the software source code.
*"Source code is the set of instructions and statements written by a programmer using a computer programming language. This code is later translated into machine language by a compiler. The translated code is referred to as object code."* (Techopedia)

**__What is the current project we are working on?__**
We're currently working on Unnamed Horror Game, an episodic collection of interactive horror stories.

**__When is the game releasing?__**
We hope to release the first episode in October of 2022.

**__How much will the game cost?__**
Nothing! The objective of BBG isn't to make money. The objective of BBG is just to make games for a living.

**__Where can I download the game?__**
You will be able to download it upon release through the Steam Storefront. 

**__I have a Mac. Will i be able to play?__**
Our intent at this time is to make the game available on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

**__How many people are on the Development team?__**
We currently have four members creating games here at BBG.

**__How can I support what you are doing?__**
As mentioned above, BBG's goal isn't to make money. However, if you would like to support us as a studio, check out our Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/bluebeangames
